Pizza Menu

This project used JavaScript to make a pizza menu for a restaurant with a radio button to select the pizza size
and boxes to check to select meats and toppings. When you click the "place order" buttom, the price is calculated for you.

Tic Tac Toe Game

A video game in which you play tic tac toe against the computer. You select your square and the computer selects a 
random square using a table of nine and a function that randomly selects an empty square from the grid. It includes
sound effects and a line drawing animation.

Calculator

A working calculator that does addition, division, multiplication, and division styled with CSS.

Final Assignment - Portfolio Website

I took my personal portfolio website I created in the previous course and added a slideshow using JS and CSS to highlight my skills.
I also added a pop up contact form that opens when clicking links or a button and can also be closed with a button. 

One Page Website with JS

I improved my band website I created in the last course and added a photo gallery with thumbnails with a lightbox effect and
a slideshow for the zoomed in photos. I also added a "sticky" button with a popup so fans can subscribe to the email list.
